CookBook App


I have a lot of random family recipes and wanted an easy way to carry them around, with no ads and simple formatting.


I'm using React as my front-end, React-Router for routing, React-Redux for snappy real-time use and state management, Firebase as a database and authentication, and Material-UI for design. Hosted on heroku. ATM it only supports logging in with a gmail account.
