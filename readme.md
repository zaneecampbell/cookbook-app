CookBook App


My midwestern mother has books upon books filled with random sheets of scrap paper for tons of recipes. This aims to solve that in a quick, searchable, website.


I'm using React as my front-end, React-Router for routing, React-Redux for snappy real-time use and state management, Firebase as a database, and Material-UI for design.
